### CarND-LaneLines-P1 (Car Street Lane Detection)
Build a data pipeline to automatically detect lanes from a video feed.  Use canny edge detection to find edges in the image (using convolutional filters to find the gradients).  Apply a region mask to isolate the lanes, then apply Hough Transformation to calculate the final lines which represent the position of the lanes.  

Hough Transformation is a feature extraction technique, typically used for detecting lines from images.  It works by apply a point-to-curve transformation (A hough transformation), and then using a polling technique to find the best fit line for the given points.
