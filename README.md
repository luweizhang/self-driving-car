### Car Lane Finding
Build a data pipeline to automatically detect lanes from a video feed.  Use canny edge detection to find edges in the image (using convolutional filters to find the gradients).  Apply a region mask to isolate the lanes, then apply Hough Transformation to calculate the final lines which represent the position of the lanes.
